# CardQuest

This game takes insperation from another card game named Ride The Bus.

In this interactive card game, players are challenged to guess various attributes of a series of cards drawn from a shuffled deck. The game unfolds in a series of rounds, each focusing on different aspects of the cards.

At the start, a deck of 52 cards is shuffled, and four cards are drawn. The game begins with the all cards displayed face-down.

Round 1 asks players to guess the color of the first card being red or black. Once revealed, the card's color determines if the player's guess was correct, and the card’s background color changes accordingly: green for a correct guess, red for an incorrect one.

In Round 2, players guess whether the second card’s value is higher or lower than the first card's. After revealing the second card, the background color of the card updates to reflect the correctness of the guess.

Round 3 presents a more complex challenge: players must decide if the value of the third card falls between or outside the values of the first two cards. As before, the third card is revealed, and feedback is given based on the player's guess.

Finally, Round 4 tests players' guessing ability to a harder level. Players have to guess the suit of the fourth card inluding options: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades. The revealed card’s suit confirms or contradicts the player's guess, with the card’s background color indicating the accuracy of the answer.

Throughout the game, players earn points for each correct guess. The total score is displayed, and at the end of each round, players have the option to restart and try their luck again with a new deck of cards.

The game features smooth animations and transitions, enhancing the visual experience as cards flip and questions appear. Players are kept engaged with dynamic feedback and the opportunity to play multiple rounds.
