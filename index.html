        <h2>Rules & Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A standard 52-card deck is shuffled, and four cards are drawn. In
            each round, a hidden card is revealed, and you must predict specific
            attributes of the card.
          </li>
          <li>
            Correct answers award 2 points. Incorrect answers award 0 points.
            The total score is displayed after each round.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the fourth card, players can choose to restart the game and
            play again with a reshuffled deck.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 10 rounds, your final score is tallied. Keep pushing to beat
            your high score each time you play!
          </li>
