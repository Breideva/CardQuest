        <h2>Rules & Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A standard 52-card deck is shuffled, and four cards are drawn. In
            each round, a hidden card is revealed, and you must predict specific
            attributes of the card
          </li>
          <li>
            The rankings start with 2 as the lowest value and go up to Ace (A)
            as the highest
          </li>
          <li>
            If the value of the second card matches the first, selecting
            'higher' will earn you points. If the value of the third card
            matches either the first or second, choosing 'inside' will award you
            points
          </li>
          <li>
            Correct answers earn you 2 points, while incorrect answers score 0
            points. Your total score is displayed after each round and continues
            to accumulate after every restart
          </li>
          <li>
            Challenge yourself to see how high you can score and how many
            correct guesses you can string together. Keep pushing your limits to
            beat your high score every time you play
          </li>
          <ul>
            <h2>Rounds</h2>
            <li>
              <span>First Card</span> - Color Guess: Predict the color of the

            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Second Card</span> - Higher or Lower: Gauge whether the
              second card’s value is higher or lower than the first card
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Third Card</span> - Between or Outside: Determine if the third
              card’s value is between or outside the first two cards' values
            </li>
            <li>
